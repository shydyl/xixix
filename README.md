## Visualized Analysis of the actual feature distribution

We utilized the labels provided in the [FFHQ features dataset](https://github.com/DCGM/ffhq-features-dataset) as our reference. We visualize the feature distribution of our method on FFHQ dataset by t-SNE. Here, we utilize the labels provided in the FFHQ features dataset as our reference. Specifically, we selected three mutually exclusive classesâ€”non-smiling, non-glasses-wearing females; smiling, non-glasses-wearing males; and non-smiling, glasses-wearing males. We compare the feature distribution of our method w/ and w/o our proposed two specific losses.

From the visualization results, we can see that when the local-scale self-adaptive rotation is not applied, the relationship between domains collapses, and when global-scale optimal distribution matching is not applied, the shape of the domain changes. It significantly demonstrates that our proposed losses can achieve the goal we have claimed.
